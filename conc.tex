\section{Conclusion}

Defining a theory presentation is the first step towards defining 
functions that compute related values 
as well as theorems for proving properties. 
In the process of defining and using these functions and theorems, users need to define some 
structures that can be automatically generated. The main aim of this work is to discover these 
structures and make them available for free for the users of the target systems. This way we 
provide support for the common tasks associated with using theory presentations. We envision the 
user defining a theory and getting a set of tools for free, by specifying 
which tools they need. Having these tools available for a large library of 
theories contribute to making formalization of software more accessible and enjoyable.
